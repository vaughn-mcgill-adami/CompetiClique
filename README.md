# CompetiClique
A simple game on graphs solved using reinforcement learning.

Rules:

Let k, m, and n be positive integers.

Two players, the builder and the forbidder, take turns modifying a graph. 

The builder's goal is to build a k vertex clique in a graph.
The forbidder's goal is to prevent this from occurring as long as possible.

We start from an empty graph. First, the builder places m edges such that none of the edges have both of their endpoints in the forbidden set. Then, the forbidder selects n vertices to include in the forbidden set. Repeat until the builder wins. The forbidden set and the graph grow throughout the game. 

Note:
When training locally on a laptop's CPU with less-than-optimal-cooling, lowering the
maximum clock rate prevented overheating.

If you use Intel P-State and are on Linux:

replace 70 with the needed percentage of max clock rate.
echo "70" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct
